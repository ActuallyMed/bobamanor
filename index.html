<h1>Dead Man's Plight</h1>
<p>They arrived from all directions.<br> In an attempt to fix connections.<br> But the last of their kind was dead. <br>And left behind a fulsome fest.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Was snacking really their choice? <br> At the time of dead people's rejoice? <br> In a fit of range, the ghost had <br> killed those who came there, partially mad</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So was their plight, <br> Seeing there, people died, <br> But the dead man was not, <br> The dead man was not dead.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So thus ended the Dead Man's Plight. <br> They had forsaken a future so bright. <br> But in the one person's still beating heart, <br> Revenge was coming, near in sight</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Created for the dead man. He invites you to <a href="https://hack.club/boba-manor">his house.</a><br> <s>You will be safe</s></p>
